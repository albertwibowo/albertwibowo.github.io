      <description>I implemented an algorithm based on a research paper and developed a streamlit app on top of it. The algorithm performs topic classifcation based on the idea of a compression algorithm, a distance metric and also KNN algorithm. Here is the link to the app: https://low-cost-classification.streamlit.app/ Feel free to use it!</description>
